Early Submission.
Test suites. I add a home page (/home) which renders the list of servlets that have been implemented, the user can click on it to invoke the servlet. 

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  (include detailed instructions, or write 'None')
I implemented a ErrorLog class to log errors into a file called errorLog.txt in root directory. 
In addition to the servlets provided, I edit the DemoServlet so it can test query string and post request, assuming there are two parameters called login and password.
